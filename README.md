# fp_postuniv

## A simple program done in Python for the Postuniversity studies of students who want to switch to IT as their main activity (professional reconversion).

### Contains a series of problems for 1 year students enrolled in the Programming Fundamentals Course from UBB Cluj.


## Project specifications

As a student you are required to solve 15 different problems regarding lists in Python. The student has to determinte the longest sublist of a given list with one of the given properties (from those 15).
This code is an example of code. The complexity level is not that of a 1 year graduate, and it should be treated as such.
Students should learn how to process and work with sublists on their own.
All the code presented here is free to use, given the origianl author is informed. For academic presentation it would be nice if you'd send me an e-mail saying you're using this repository.
